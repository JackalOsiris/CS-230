In this assignment I developed a design document for The Gaming Room.  They have an android app called “Draw It or Lose it” that slowly renders a random picture players must guess as it is revealed before the picture is fully rendered.  
One of my strengths in this document was detailing the UML diagram.  I had a strong understanding about how the code flowed and it was easy to explain it verbally once I had a visual representation.  This part of the document is what helped drive my development of the code.  By understanding the relationship “game” had to “game service” it made sense on how the classes were established.  
The one thing I’d like to revise is the development requirements.  For this project I have a basic understanding of how an OS operates but I do not understand the differences of each OS when it comes development.  Yes, there are different tools for different platforms but what I don’t understand are the basic processes of Windows and iOS and how they differ.  
This shows just how much of a “Junior Developer” I truly am.  I enjoy programming and developing code, but it scares me to think I could develop something viable and useful.  
When it comes to developing for a specific client you must consider their needs such as budget and time.  For example, I included using the stock images from the original game to save money on copyright.  One thing I did not consider was using the same directory the images are already stored on, that is if their current server can handle the load.
